# OpenCV_Starting
🚀 Learning OpenCV through the official OpenCV tutorials.
I’m building hands-on projects and practicing real-time computer vision tasks such as:

• Image processing
• Webcam video capture
• Face detection
• Object detection

This repo documents my step-by-step learning journey in OpenCV with Python.

# Currently, I am beginning with the installation and environment setup process. This repository will include all my practice programs, experiments, and step-by-step progress in computer vision using Python.
