# OpenCV_Starting
🚀 Learning OpenCV through the official OpenCV tutorials.
I’m building hands-on projects and practicing real-time computer vision tasks such as:

• Image processing
• Webcam video capture
• Face detection
• Object detection

This repo documents my step-by-step learning journey in OpenCV with Python.

### Currently, I am beginning with the installation and environment setup process. This repository will include all my practice programs, experiments, and step-by-step progress in computer vision using Python.

## 🛠️ Installation Process

1️⃣ Install Python (3.x recommended)
Download from: https://www.python.org

2️⃣ Install OpenCV using pip

pip install opencv-python

3️⃣ (Optional) Install additional modules

pip install opencv-contrib-python

4️⃣ Verify Installation

import cv2
print(cv2.__version__)

If the version prints successfully, OpenCV is installed correctly ✅

This repository will be regularly updated as I progress through image processing, video capture, face detection, and object detection tutorials.
